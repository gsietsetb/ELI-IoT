            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            This document aims to present the general ideas and methodology
            that may be used in order to design, develop and finally conduct
            performance tests in order to optimize the metrics of each of the
            evaluation criteria (i.e. reliability of the send data, end-to-end
            latency and and power consumption).<hr>
            <h3><span class="titlemark">2 </span>Introduction</h3>
            According to EWSN 2016 Dependability challenge specifications,
            we devise several solution candidates for the high-interference
            wireless sensor network environments to achieve high
            energy-efficiency (measured as average energy consumed per
            successful application layer packet transmission) and low
            latency. The challenge uses off-the-shelf Maxfor MTM-5000
            sensor nodes, which bring some computational and memory
            constraints.           <hr>
            <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2 </span>  Proposed Solutions</h3>
            We take two approaches for this challenge: i) optimization of
            standardized communication protocol stack through tweaking the
            parameters of different protocols within stack as we have done in
            <span class="cite">[<span 
                    class="ptmb7t-">?</span>]</span>, ii) a cross-layer approach that uses stateless routing as in <span class="cite">[<span 
                    class="ptmb7t-">?</span>]</span>.
            In the following we detail these two approaches. For the first
            approach, we employ the protocols devised by Internet
            Engineering Task Force (IETF) for Internet of Things (IoT)
            applications.
            <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1    </span> <a 
                    id="x1-70002.1"></a>IETF IoT Protocol Stack</h4>
            IETF has developed several solutions for each layer of the OSI
            protocol stack considering the limitations of the IoT devices
            could bring. We will be using the stack that is composed of
            CoAP/UDP/IPv6-RPL/6LoWPAN/IEEE 802.15.4. As an option,
            the CoCoA algorithm <span class="cite">[<span 
                    class="ptmb7t-">?</span>]</span> proposed for congestion control over
            CoAP is also considered within this stack. The derivation of
            optimal parameter settings for different layers will be studied for
            interference-environments. As an example, the RPL protocol
            parameters investigated are minimum Trickle interval size      (Imin), the RPL DIO redundancy (K), and the Parent Switch
            Threshold (PST) defined by the Objective Function used.
            These parameters determine how frequently the RPL control
            messages are transmitted. The clear trade-off of network
            stability vs. amount of overhead traffic is assessed within this
            work.
            <!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >     A clear solution for the MAC and PHY layers for interference
                environment is the Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode
                of IEEE802.15.4e that has been standardized in 2012. TSCH
                enables low-power operation through time synchronization and
                channel hopping for high reliability. As the targeted platform
                does not include an RF chip with this functionality, one option
                considered in this work is the implementation of the MAC layer
                of this standard.

            <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2    </span> <a id="x1-80002.2"></a>Cross-layer Approach with Stateless Routing</h4>
            <!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Even though using the inherit capabilities of the well-known
                IEEE 802.15.4-based stacks such as ZigBee or IETF IoT stack,
                one can implement a functional solution for the targeted
                environment, it is clear that there are inefficiency incurred, such
                as the encapsulation of network, transport and application
                protocol packets, missing communication of state information
                between layers, etc. Taking this into account, a potentially
                simpler and leaner solution for the specific application of the
                challenge can be developed.

            </p>
            <!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >     For this, we consider a stateless routing protocol that
                incorporates the MAC layer functionalities. Regarding the kind
                of topology and the challenge requirements, a stateless
                routing is expected to considerably increase the end-to-end
                performance, while allowing an easier implementation after a
                short network discovery phase at the beginning. The purpose of
                this discovery phase is to assign rank numbers (number of hops
                to reach the sink) to nodes. The basic idea of the method is
                then the following. When a sender node has some data
                ready to send, it sends an RTS with its rank number. The
                available relay nodes with a higher (and possibly equal) rank
                will send a CTS back, then the data transmission will be
                carried out. This approach does not require any neighbor
                information, nor routing table information, allowing an
                asynchronous system and it is impervious to any broken
                links or nodes. MAC reliability is enabled through ACK
                packets.
                <!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >     Another important aspect that must be taken into consideration
                is how the interference nodes can be avoided. A channel hoping
                and duty cycling approach will be used for this purpose.

            <!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >In order to devise and evaluate the solutions involving different
                network topologies and different strategies, there are several
                evaluation methodologies that can be used.
            <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1    </span> <a 
                    id="x1-100003.1"></a>Simulation</h4>
            <!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >An available tool for the two operating systems for the
                constrained nodes, TinyOS and ContikiOS, is Cooja Simulator.
                This software allows the user to establish the desired network
                topology, with different number of devices and surrounding

                objects, obstacles or interferences. It also allows collecting the
                performance information such as delays, errors and energy
                consumption, which are the target to beat within the challenge
                context.
                <!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >  However the ultimate results of a simulation only match to
                predictions and estimations based on the possible behavior,
                actually treating it as much as possible with real capabilities.

            <!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Another approach to perform tests and check possible programming
                issues involves the use of a group of physical nodes in which
                each of them are separately programmed, including at least one
                sensing and one sink node and few other intermediate node in
                order to test the behaviour of the developed algorithms. However,
                a larger size TelosB testbed is available in our university,
                consisting on a large grid topology of 6x10 TelosB boards,
                already used in evaluations of <span class="cite">[<span 
                        class="ptmb7t-">?</span>]</span>. This testbed can be used for   physical environment tests and validation of simulation
                results.

            <!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >Due to embedded system capabilities regarding the available
                boards, two OS options become potentially useful within this
                context: TinyOS and ContikiOS. A further more detailed analysis
                would be performed in order to choose which one fits better with
                the project requirements.
